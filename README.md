# SIT753-Task6.1-ci-cd-pipeline
This is for task 6- required to create a Jenkins pipeline that integrates with GitHub. We will also be required to integrate email notifications to inform developers about build status and deployment events. Additionally, for each stage of the pipeline, we will be required to specify or research a tool that can be used for that stage.
